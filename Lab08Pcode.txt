1) prototype 5 functions a prompt the 2 datainputs and the 2 compute charges
once input takes 2 double and the other takes an int and 3 doubles these
are call by ref vars, its the same for compute charges but call by val.

2) make main, in main make the days, rate, meds, services, and total vars.

3) make prompt with a char switch that directs the program based on input
and selects the function based on what the arguments sent are

4)add a default that kills program if they put in the wrong thing.

5) make datainput call by ref for the inpaitent for arguments all vars will be used
this is how the program will know what to chose. have do whiles around output prompts
that take desired data in.

6) make the outpaitent the same as inpaitent but only use meds and services data and args

7) call compute charges at the end of each input fun

8) the 2 compute charges just need to sum the data inputs from datainputs make 
sure to have number of args that corresponds to the sum that is needed.
