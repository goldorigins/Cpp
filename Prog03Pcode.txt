a)
1) have a for loop bring in the 2 variables and test them to be positive
2) have another for loop that will use I to iterate over the distance between the 2 variables
3) this can be done by having i=1 then i++ for each repeat untill i=user input
4)have a variable count from 1 to i since i will be equal to the input at the end of the loop
this variable will acumulate the sum of the integers

b)
1) bring in a pair of integers
2) add one to the first integer and set the condition on the while 
loop to run as long as the first is smaller than the second
3) every time to loop runs there should be  a counter to simply count as many times the loop has ran
this will be the space between the inputs

c)
1)have a loop on the outside to check for positive exponey input
2) since n^3= n*n*n we can just take the first input and multiply it by itsself as many times as the loop
3) so so for every run of the loop there should be an acumulator that multiplies an acumulated value
by the first value
4) the while loop will repeat this process by having a count that goes untill it is less than or equal to the exponet
