1) prototype 3 functions one to get a non neg int, another to 
do a calculation with the int, the last to print the results of the calculation

2) put in barebones functions with some output and call them in main

3) in the input get function add a header. Then add a do while loop to prompt
for a non negative integer. return this input

4) bring the input into the calculation function from main. 

5) I see it in my mind as calculationg the numeratior which is going to 
oscilate +- and teh denomenator which will change with values of k
-create a for loop that says: start at 0 and run up to and including 
the input. the first runthrough will use 0 so its k++ not ++k
-inside the loop add a numerator calculation that is going to be 
the previous value times -1. Start with -1 so the first runthrough 
produces a pos 1
-calculate the denomenator using the current itteration of the loop
- divide the numer by denom and add this to a running counter that will
add the current itteration to a sum of all previous runs. 
-once this is done multiply this by 4 and return it to main

6) send the calculation to an output function also find out a way to make 10 digits
to the right of the decimal.
