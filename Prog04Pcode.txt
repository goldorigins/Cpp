1)prototype all the functions with the specified names
2)make myPrompt and have it output something then call it in the main
3)make mySum, myFact, and myMod and have them output something in main
4)make a do while loop in myPrompt to ask for a non-neg number
return this input and call it in the main as user input
5)create myPrint, in here put an if else loop to try the 3 conditions
fill each condition with the coresponding output sum,mod,fact 
6)call my print in main and push user input through it to 
make sure the if function is correctly pointing to what will be 
the output lines.
7)fill the calculations functions with the logical stuff
8)in main use the same if else loop as in Print but call each function
inside its logical trigger. Set a each fun return to the same var name
9)change the stuff in myPrint to the desired text output and push the 
logically determined result from the main into myPrint
10)put a while loop around stuff in main to make it go again and check for sentinel
EDIT: I ended up using for loop in main so that if first entry was sentinel it would kill
insted of running atleast once.
